        Hello,<br>
        I am Konrad, a CS student at the Otto-von-Guericke Universit√§t in Magdeburg, Germany.<br>
        The repositories you can find around here are some of my personal projects which I make whenever I find the time and motivation to do so.<br>
        Hopefully, this list will continue to grow, though probably not at light speed.
      </div>
      <div class='title'>why the 'about me'?</div>
      <div class='basic'>
        Someone with more experience than myself told me to do it, even if I don't have anything to show.<br>
        It's also a good front-end exercise I suppose.
      </div>
      <div class='title'>where do I exist?</div>
      <div class='basic'>
        On Github.<br>
        <a href="url">https://github.com/konradgithuup</a>
      </div>
      <div class='title'>my <del>atrocities</del> repos </div>
      <div class='basic'>
        This is where I will put my repositories in a future commit.
